Pre-Requisutes For the script:
Sign Out of the current Amazon Account

The order of the tests do not matter.

The tests covered are:
1) Add an item to card
2) Add an item to the wishlist
3)Create a wishlist
4)Delete a wishlist
5)Search the site for an item that exists
6)Search the site for an item that does not exist
7)Try to sign in with an invalid email
8)Try to sign in with an invalid password
9)Sign in with all valid credentials
10)Signout


Preferred order (Will be used for Demo):
7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 ->10
Note*: No need to follow the order, each test runs individually

The .side file is the entire script with all the tests, this can be imported into the Selenium IDE to run the tests individually.
PS. The tests will not work if the Run All Tests button is clicked since they are not in order, but will work when ran individually as clearly shown in the demo.
