## DataUtilities statistics from Lab 03

## DataUtilities statistics after adding more unit tests

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes
Our mutation testing results indicate a noticeably greater efficacy for the Range and DataUtilities Classes. Range class's mutation coverage score improved by 20%, bringing the overall mutation coverage score up by 43%. The fact that our tests exceeded the requisite 10% increase specified at the markdown file demonstrates the lab's performance. These advancements in mutation testing aid in the detection of potential flaws and problems in the source code, which eventually results in a more reliable and practical software system. It's also crucial to keep in mind that as our mutation testing's coverage expands, it gets tougher to find mutations.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
Implementing mutation testing is primarily done to improve the testing process' efficacy and, as a result, the software's quality. We may evaluate the efficiency and test coverage of the JUnit tests created for the application by making minor modifications to the source code. An efficient test suite would have a high mutation score, indicating that the code was being thoroughly evaluated while being exposed to a wide range of inputs.
